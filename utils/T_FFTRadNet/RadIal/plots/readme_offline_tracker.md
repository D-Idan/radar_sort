## Summary

I've implemented both requested features:

### 1. Confidence-Based Track Initiation and Association

**New Parameters Added to `tracker_config`:**
- `min_confidence_init`: Minimum confidence required to start a new track (default: 0.7)
- `min_confidence_assoc`: Minimum confidence required for association (default: 0.4) 
- `confidence_weight`: Weight for confidence in cost calculation (default: 0.3)
- `association_strategy`: Strategy to use (default: "confidence_weighted")

**Four Association Strategies Implemented:**
1. **`distance_only`**: Traditional distance-based association
2. **`confidence_weighted`**: Distance weighted by detection confidence
3. **`confidence_gated`**: Hard confidence threshold with distance
4. **`hybrid_score`**: Sophisticated combination of distance, confidence, Mahalanobis distance, and track quality

**Key Features:**
- Prevents low-confidence detections from starting new tracks
- Uses different confidence thresholds for initiation vs association
- Multiple association strategies for different scenarios
- Configurable parameters exposed through tracker_config

### 2. Centralized Output Structure

**New Directory Structure:**
```
output_dir/
├── tracks/               # CSV tracking results
├── visualizations/
│   ├── frames/          # Individual frame images
│   └── summary/         # Summary plots
├── logs/                # Text summaries and logs
└── config/              # Configuration files
```

**Changes Made:**
- Added `output_dir` parameter to `offline_tracking()`
- Created `setup_output_directories()` function
- Updated all visualization functions to use centralized paths
- Added configuration saving functionality
- All outputs now go to specified subdirectories

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Example with confidence-based tracking
custom_config = {
    'min_confidence_init': 0.8,     # High threshold for new tracks
    'min_confidence_assoc': 0.5,    # Lower for associations
    'association_strategy': 'hybrid_score'  # Most sophisticated
}

offline_tracking(
    preds_csv="predictions.csv",
    labels_csv="labels.csv", 
    output_dir="./my_tracking_results",
    tracker_config=custom_config
)
```

The implementation is backward-compatible and provides sensible defaults while allowing full customization of confidence-based behavior and output organization.

A common issue in radar tracking where the Kalman filter can predict tracks outside the sensor's field of view. 
implement range culling to remove tracks that predict positions beyond the radar's coverage area.


## Key Features of Range Culling Implementation:

1. **Configurable Parameters:**
   - `enable_range_culling`: Toggle feature on/off
   - `max_range`, `min_azimuth_deg`, `max_azimuth_deg`: Radar coverage limits
   - `range_buffer`, `azimuth_buffer_deg`: Buffer zones to avoid aggressive culling

2. **Smart Culling Logic:**
   - Checks predicted track positions after Kalman prediction
   - Uses buffer zones to avoid killing tracks that are just barely out of range
   - Only applies to track predictions, not initial detections (those are filtered separately)

3. **Statistics Tracking:**
   - Counts how many tracks were culled for analysis
   - Optional logging of which tracks were culled and why

4. **Multiple Check Points:**
   - Initial detection filtering when creating new tracks
   - Predicted track position checking after Kalman prediction
   - Buffer zones prevent oscillating track creation/deletion

The range culling will help prevent tracks from drifting outside the sensor's field of view and consuming computational resources on impossible track states. The buffer zones provide tolerance for tracking objects near the edge of coverage.
